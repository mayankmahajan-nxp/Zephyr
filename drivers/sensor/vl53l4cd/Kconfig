	  Threshold used for proximity detection when sensor is used with SENSOR_CHAN_PROX.

config VL53L4CD_RECONFIGURE_ADDRESS

	depends on VL53L4CD
	help
	  Enable support for reconfiguring the sensor address at runtime.
	  When this option is enabled, all sensors declared in the device tree
	  must have an xshut-gpio property.

	  All sensors are disabled during initialization. When reading the first
	  value from a sensor, it is powered up and its I2C address is reconfigured
	  from the manufacturer default (0x29) to the address specified in the
	  device tree.
