      Driving the XSHUT pin low puts the VL53L4CD into hardware
      standby (if VDD is present) or complete power off (if
      VDD is not present). Additionally, if XSHUT is connected
      directly to VDD, the sensor will go into boot mode on a
      transition from LOW to HIGH.

      An interrupt is raised when a data measurement is ready.
        GPIO1 is the interrupt pin on the VL53L4CD (ACTIVE LOW).
      This can be disabled if the user prefers to use polling instead.
